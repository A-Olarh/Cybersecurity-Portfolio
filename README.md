## 🧪 Personal Home Lab Projects

These are cybersecurity simulations I personally designed and executed in my home lab to deepen my understanding of threat detection, log analysis, and incident response.

### 🔐 SSH Brute Force Attack + Fail2Ban Defense

Simulated a brute-force SSH attack using Hydra from Kali Linux against an Ubuntu server. Implemented blue team defense using Fail2Ban to detect and block repeated failed login attempts.
