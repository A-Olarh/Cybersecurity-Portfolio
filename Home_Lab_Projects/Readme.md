# 🧪 Personal Home Lab Projects

These are cybersecurity simulations I personally designed and executed in my home lab to deepen my understanding of threat detection, log analysis, and incident response.

### 🔐 SSH Brute Force Attack + Fail2Ban Defense

**Objective:**  
Simulate a brute-force SSH attack using Hydra from Kali Linux against an Ubuntu target, analyze authentication logs, and deploy Fail2Ban to detect and prevent repeated failed login attempts.

**Outcome:**  
Demonstrated how attackers exploit weak credentials and how Fail2Ban can dynamically detect and block malicious IPs using log-based intrusion prevention.

### 🔒 SSH Firewall Hardening & Logging with UFW

**Objective:**  
Configure firewall rules using UFW to restrict SSH access and enhance system security in a virtual Ubuntu environment. Enable logging to monitor connection attempts and validated rule effectiveness through simulated traffic.

**Outcome:**  
Strengthened SSH access control and gained experience in preventive firewall configuration and traffic monitoring using UFW.

### 📁 FTP Brute Force Attack + Log Analysis

**Objective:**  
Simulate and analyze an FTP brute-force attack using Hydra, review vsftpd logs for intrusion detection, and document the incident using a structured reporting format.

**Outcome:**  
Gained hands-on experience in log analysis and incident documentation, reinforcing the importance of timely detection and structured reporting in cybersecurity operations.
